2D Graph in Swift 3

This 2D Graph isn't perfect. It is the Swift 3 version of the graph I used in Hydration (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hydration/id1154132184).

It is fast and very easy to work with. It only needs an array of double value for X and Y axis.

This version tries to autoscale the values in order to always display them in the graph. This feature still needs work.
It works ONLY for positive values. Hydrations has only positive values.
